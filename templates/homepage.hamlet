<h1>BlockApps.net - the most convenient and reliable API for writing Blockchain Based applications.

<p>
  All blockchain based applications will need to pull information from the blockchain. We've made that
  process simple. We've created an intuitive RESTful API for querying the Ethereum Blockchain. Our Haskell based
  Ethereum network peer (client) is compliant with PoC9 and can also be used as a web server. But you don't have to
  install the peer - simply follow the links below to try the API. 

 <p>
  We have static <a href="/query">GET routes</a> for transactions, blocks and account states.
  More generally, we support <a href="help.html">query strings</a>.
  See the descriptions within, including examples.

  Also, check out a <a href="/index.html">demo</a> of how to parse and visualize the records you've requested.

<h2>Coming Soon:

<p>
 <ol> 
  <li> Push Notifications - be notified of new blocks, transaction confirmations, as they happen.
  <li> Transaction Signing - sign transactions in the browser, and push them to the network - without running a client locally.
  <li> Network Statistics - view the health of the network, in real time.
